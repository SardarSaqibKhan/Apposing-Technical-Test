### Apposing iOS Technical Test Developer Feedback:

The Technical test was designed in that way it covers most of developing skills from logic building to customized UI with challenging auto layout.

The first challenge i faced making tagview list the first idea popped in my mind was to customize uicollectionview but its time taking and harder to customize whereas approaching any third party library is time efficient and now a days most developers rely on such libraries, so i decided to go with it but the issue i face to set constraint on it the behavior of tagviewlist was unscrollable so when more tags to show then it become messy and went out of screen to resolve it i added scroll view.
The next challenge i faced with scrollview i need to give dynamic height according to tagview content height so far i wasn't able to solve it 

The third challenge i had faced on add skill screen the task was to search skills from searchbar and selection of searched skill and then if user remove search or close search i need to save the selected skill.
